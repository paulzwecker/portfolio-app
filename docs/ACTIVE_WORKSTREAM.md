## C2.2 — Daily Portfolio Data (BUILD)

- Branch `codex/portfolio-data-ledger-capabilities`, based on main `395f842`.
- PR #25 is complete and awaiting owner review. Keep it frozen. Integrate its
  receipt compatibility fix after owner merge; preserve this branch's capability roadmap.
- Objective: provider-only cloud refresh → durable outcomes → trustworthy portfolio
  valuation/freshness, reusing existing adapters, jobs and domain calculations.

## Completed build increments

- `1e70d66` adds provider-only recurring cycles with existing locks/cadences/receipts,
  optional FMP and preserved manual queue/unrelated tables.
- Cloud CLI defaults to `--scope market-data`. `provider-data` adds due SEC and
  explicitly enabled FMP. `all-operations` explicitly selects the full legacy cycle.
  Cloud calls retain configured proxy routing and print safe status/class summaries.
- Partial/nested failures exit nonzero. Fixed an unset retry-delay variable after
  provider exceptions and protected another instance's heartbeat during overlap.
- Focused worker/guard/market regression passed 106 cases. Final cloud regression
  passed 27 cases. Strict types passed for five files, plus lint, formatting,
  documentation links and whitespace checks.
  Existing detailed outcomes remain in database run ledgers. No UI changed.

## Next build steps

1. Reconcile market startup scope with the reviewed held-listing/FX plan. Existing
   startup/scheduled paths add TWD/EUR for legacy model use and can cold-backfill
   ten years. Inspect `market_data_startup.py` and `external_ingestion._scope_for_domain`.
   Preserve justified model FX requirements through an explicit reviewed policy. Pin
   scope, history overlap and per-cycle budgets before production activation.
2. Prove synthetic refresh → EUR valuation and Operations readback, including
   restart, partial/outage/retry behavior. Inspect desktop/mobile when UI changes.

Keep tests focused during BUILD. Comprehensive quality, browser review and one PR
belong to the completed milestone's INTEGRATE gate. Production backfill/scheduling,
current-state recovery, source/model acceptance and migrations need separate authorization.
